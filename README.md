Clounify - Spot Instance Based Cloud Orchestration

I'ts a low cost for the masses! This project aim to create a simple cloud orchestration based on the spot instance request and orchestrating it into single and power-full instance by using several technology such as Ceph for cluster storage and NGINX as a load balancer.

- Upscale and downscale the spot instance to reduce the cost.
- Harnessing data persistence using EBS and Ceph as cluster storage for redundancy.
- Route53, AWS tool and others to aid a process of orchestrating the master to slave instance.
- NGINX as a load balancer to distribute traffic across active instance.
- Developed linux script will simplify the process of installation and configuration.
